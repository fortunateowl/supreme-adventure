Some more simple data cleaning

Another assignment from the UW program, goal was to clean some data and present a bunch of graphs.

The output looks a bit disorganized, may come back to this to clean it up one day.

Repo includes the ever changing DataClean file, where I keep my most often used data cleaning functions.
